Once upon a time, in a small village, there lived a kind girl named Lilly. 
She loved to explore the nearby forest and make friends with animals. 
One day, she found an injured bird and took care of it until it could fly again. 
The bird returned every morning to sing for Lilly as a token of gratitude.
